First task as an 8th Light Resident Apprentice
Unbeatable AI Tic Tac Toe in Ruby with testing in RSpec

After completion of the original task I was given the task of adding internationalization(1 language) and options for player vs. player, as well as ai vs. ai. In my own time I started working on cucumber testing but didn't finish due to being given another task.

In order to run, download files and at the command prompt in the lib folder run:

	ruby play.rb
